# Contributors-Leaderboard
LeaderBoard for OpenLake Contributors. Ranking will be given to each contributor based on their contributions, activeness and their github profile (commits/stars etc.). Email notification will be sent when rank of a contributor goes up or down. Metrics will promote consistent work instead of bulk work done at once.
